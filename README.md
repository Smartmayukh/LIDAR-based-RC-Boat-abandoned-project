# LIDAR-based-RC-Boat-abandoned-project

Lidar-based research under the supervision of Dr. P. Venkateswaran. This research project mainly focused on designing a autonomous boat that can do underwater mapping using a Lidar.

Project scrapped due to lack of resources in College. 

If anyone wants to further my studies in form of a paper or journal feel free to do so. Reach out to me @ mayukhmalidas322@gmail.com
